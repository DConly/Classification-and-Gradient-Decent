# Classification-and-Gradient-Decent
For this project, the code performs Binary Classification on the wine.csv data. It predicts wine quality using logistic regression, Linear discriminant analysis ,  quadratic discriminant analysis, and Naive Bayes. It computes and displays the accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall. It displays the confusion matrix and ROC curve for each method.


The code then implements the LogisticRegressionGD() class that performs logistic regression using gradient descent. It uses logistic regression to show binary classification of the example data.
